Add inserts to All_table_creation.sql so, that there is more than 10 houses and apartments.

Run app and show, that client-side paging is already working.

Show in debug - network - getall - response, that all entries are still on page, so we need server-side filtering.

Go to HouseController, edit GetAll method (add parameters and filtering in the method's content).

Go to houseIndexActions.jsx:
	- modify detHouses (add parameters)
	- modify receiveHouses (add totalCount)

Go to houseIndexReducer.jsx:
	- add totalCount to initialState
	- add totalCount in GET_HOUSES_SUCCESS

Go to houseIndex.jsx.
	- add totalCount to mapStateToProps
	- add pagination parameter to getHouses
	- add totalCount in render()
	- add onChange handler to Table, so we get new content from server when changing current table page.
	- add map to housesInfo in render()
	- clear first isLoading handler
	- cut columnsInfo outside of render

Show new getall response in debug.

Repeat with apartmentIndex JSX components and ApartmentIndex controller.
